#summary OpenAirport version 2.0 demo server

= Demo Server =

A demo server of an OpenAirport implementation is available by clicking this [http://demoserver.openairport.org/ link].  It is limited to a code base slightly older than 2.1.2 and only has parts of the 327 and 339 inspection actions. There is more in the code base not shown here, but provides a general outline of how to enter and view inspections.
